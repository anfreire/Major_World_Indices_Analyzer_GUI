#### Description:
We are on the verge of a financial disaster, and there are numerous investments being made every day.
Some may be excellent, while others may not be.

I came to the conclusion that long-term investments are the safest after conducting some study on the subject.
I started looking for the finest long-term stock or equities that would yield a healthy return and provide some measure of investor security, and this is how I discovered Index Funds.

The "Major World, Indices Analyzer" is a program I developed to make investing in this field easier.
Examining the top 36 index funds, according Yahoo Finance, is the focus of this work.

This tool's graphical user interface makes it simple to use and appealing to the eye.
Possesses the capacity to create interactive graphs, where the user may specify both the index fund and the time period for the costumes.
The user has the option to save the results in an XLSX file and plot the [High, Low, Open, Close, and Volume] data (excel default format).
The name of the chosen Index Fund is preserved in the stored file, followed by the current date.

To prevent execution problems and to guarantee that the tool works as intended, this software has input user protection.
Any incorrect data will be returned with an error message that explains how the application should work properly.

One feature that this project provides is that the user's data input is not lost during the transition between pages, allowing users to examine the Indices more quickly or preventing data loss due to accidental clicks.

I am grateful to Harvard, CS50, and Professor David J. Malan especially.
